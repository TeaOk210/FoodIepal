Welcome to my repository! Here you will find an example of implementing an application for registering and authorizing users on Kotlin using SQLite.

To run the application, you need to have Android Studio and Kotlin installed on it.

The application implements a simple field check during registration, which makes sure that the user has entered the correct data and the passwords match. There is also a check for the presence of an existing user in the database.

The application has two screens: registration and authorization. After registering the user, he can log in to the application by entering his username and password.

All the code is available in the repository. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. Thanks for your attention!
